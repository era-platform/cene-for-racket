# Cene for Racket

[![Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/era-platform/cene-for-racket.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/era-platform/cene-for-racket)

(TODO: Write a blurb.)


## Installation and use

This is a library for Racket. To install it, run `raco pkg install --deps search-auto` from the `cene-lib/` directory, and then put an import like `(require cene)` in your Racket program.

The interface to Cene will eventually be documented in the `cene-doc/` package's documentation.
