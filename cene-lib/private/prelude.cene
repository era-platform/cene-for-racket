\= TODO: Work up to defining `defn` and `def-macro`. In order to do
\= that, we've been porting things to Cene local variables that we've
\= already implemented on the Racket side. Once we use these local
\= variables to define `defn` and `def-macro`, we'll want to repeat a
\= number of these ported definitions in `defn` form as well. It may
\= be possible to reuse the definitions rather than copying and
\= pasting, but let's regard copying and pasting as a serious option
\= here.

\= TODO: Make sure we make most of the things we define in the prelude
\= visible to user-supplied Cene code by using
\= `effects-add-init-package-step`.
